# Script Creation and Consistency Manager Assistant

## Program Plan for Script Creation and Management

### Main Objective
Develop an agent that automatically generates, reviews, and manages all essential documents for script development. This includes plot, character, and story consistency, as well as generating new documents as required by the story’s unique needs.

### Key Goals
1. **Script Generation:** Automatically create scripts from story inputs and manage existing plot, character, and story JSON files.
2. **Consistency Validation:** Validate that all story elements are coherent and aligned with overarching themes and character arcs.
3. **Document Expansion:** Generate additional documents (e.g., beat sheets, scene breakdowns) based on story requirements.
4. **Iterative Refinement:** Provide iterative feedback for script improvements based on user inputs and AI-driven insights.


### Tools and Actions

#### **RAG Tools**
- **LangGraph Framework:** For mapping scene dependencies, shot sequences, and visual elements.
- **Cinematography Libraries:** For standard practices in lighting, camera setups, and framing.
- **Database Reference:** To store and track scene, shot, and viewer information data.

#### **Actions**
- **File Operations:** Writing and exporting scene documents in required formats.
- **Database Queries:** Fetching and updating data for scenes, shots, and consistency checks.
- **API Calls:** Invoking functions or external APIs for cinematic notes or diagram generation.
- **Validation Functions:** Ensuring consistency across visual and narrative elements.
- **Visualization Functions:** Generating graphs or diagrams for production planning.
- **Validation Engine:** To ensure adherence to storytelling frameworks.

### Modules and Functional Components

#### 1. **Script Generation Module**
   - Generate script drafts from story outlines and character profiles.
   - Use templates for consistent formatting and scene descriptions.

#### 2. **Consistency Validator**
   - Validate logical flow across plot points, character arcs, and themes.
   - Highlight inconsistencies in dialogue, tone, or pacing.

#### 3. **Document Expansion Module**
   - Create supplementary documents like:
     - Scene breakdowns
     - Beat sheets
     - Dialogue maps

#### 4. **Feedback and Iteration Engine**
   - Provide actionable feedback on existing scripts.
   - Suggest rewrites or alternative approaches to problematic sections.

#### 5. **Export Module**
   - Compile all documents into industry-standard formats for collaborative workflows.

### Process Steps

#### Step 1: **Document Collection and Initialization**
1. Load existing story, plot, and character JSON files.
2. Parse the data to identify key elements and dependencies.
3. **Next Action:** Generate an initial draft script based on the story’s premise.

#### Step 2: **Script Drafting**
1. Use plot points and character arcs to structure scenes.
2. Incorporate thematic elements and dialogue generated by the AI.
3. **Next Action:** Validate the draft for consistency and logical coherence.

#### Step 3: **Consistency Checks**
1. Cross-reference scenes with character arcs and plot points.
2. Identify gaps or redundancies in storytelling.
3. **Next Action:** Suggest corrections or additional scenes to address issues.

#### Step 4: **Document Expansion**
1. Generate detailed scene breakdowns with purposes and emotional beats.
2. Create beat sheets mapping major turning points.
3. **Next Action:** Compile all documents for user review.

#### Step 5: **Feedback and Refinement**
1. Provide detailed feedback on weak points or inconsistencies.
2. Allow users to suggest edits or approve changes.
3. **Next Action:** Iterate on the script until it meets quality standards.

#### Step 6: **Final Export**
1. Export the final script and supporting documents in editable and distributable formats.
2. **Next Action:** Transition the script to the next assistant in the pipeline.

### Guardrails and Reference Checks

1. **Ensure Narrative Integrity:** Validate alignment with established story frameworks.
2. **Adhere to Industry Standards:** Follow screenplay formatting rules and conventions.
3. **Foster Creative Control:** Allow users to override or refine AI-generated outputs.
4. **Maintain Coherence:** Ensure thematic and tonal consistency throughout the script.

### Example LangGraph Code Snippet

```python
from langgraph import Graph, Node

# Initialize LangGraph
graph = Graph(name="Script Dependency Graph")

# Create nodes for components
script_node = Node("Script", value="Initial Draft")
character_node = Node("Character Arc", value="Hero's Journey")
plot_node = Node("Plot", value="Rising Action")

# Establish dependencies
graph.add_edge(character_node, plot_node, label="influences")
graph.add_edge(plot_node, script_node, label="shapes")

# Validate consistency
graph.validate()
```

---

# Transition to Next Assistant
The finalized script and supporting documents will be passed to the Director and Cinematographer Assistant for further development.
