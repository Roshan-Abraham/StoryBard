# LangGraph-based Assistant for Story Document Creation

## Program Plan for Document Creation and Data Collection

### Main Objective
Create an intelligent system that automates the creation, data collection, and random generation of movie/story documents within the LangGraph framework. The assistant will streamline workflows for storytellers and filmmakers, integrating dependency mapping, validation, and iterative refinement.

### Key Goals
1. **Automate Data Collection:** Enable users to input key parameters like themes, characters, and plot points.
2. **Random Generation:** Introduce controlled randomness to fill template blanks creatively.
3. **Dependency Management:** Automatically map dependencies between story components (e.g., character arcs to plot points).
4. **Validation and Guardrails:** Ensure logical coherence and adherence to cinematic storytelling rules.
5. **Iterative Refinement:** Support user-driven iterations with feedback loops.


### Tools and Actions

#### **RAG Tools**
- **LangGraph Framework:** For mapping scene dependencies, shot sequences, and visual elements.
- **Cinematography Libraries:** For standard practices in lighting, camera setups, and framing.
- **Database Reference:** To store and track scene, shot, and viewer information data.

#### **Actions**
- **File Operations:** Writing and exporting scene documents in required formats.
- **Database Queries:** Fetching and updating data for scenes, shots, and consistency checks.
- **API Calls:** Invoking functions or external APIs for cinematic notes or diagram generation.
- **Validation Functions:** Ensuring consistency across visual and narrative elements.
- **Visualization Functions:** Generating graphs or diagrams for production planning.

### Modules and Functional Components

#### 1. **Input Module**
   - Collect initial parameters like genre, theme, and main conflict.
   - Provided templates from archives for user inputs (e.g., character profiles, plot structures).

#### 2. **Randomization Engine**
   - Use NLP models to generate random names, conflicts, and visual elements.
   - Ensure that randomness is bounded by user-defined parameters.

#### 3. **Dependency Mapper**
   - Establish relationships between story components.
   - For example, a character’s arc might influence plot turning points.

#### 4. **Validation Engine**
   - Check for coherence and alignment with cinematic rules (e.g., the three-act structure).
   - Provide feedback on areas that need refinement.

#### 5. **Export Module**
   - Enable users to export documents in industry-standard formats (PDF, Word).
   - Integrate with third-party tools like Final Draft.

### Process Steps

#### Step 1: **Story Overview Creation**
1. Input or randomly generate a title, logline, and theme.
2. Map the theme to key moral and symbolic elements using LangGraph.
3. **Next Action:** Validate the theme’s alignment with the genre.

#### Step 2: **Character Development**
1. Create a profile for each character, including name, traits, and arcs.
2. Generate random traits if needed, ensuring coherence with the plot.
3. **Next Action:** Link character motivations to the central conflict.

#### Step 3: **Plot Structure**
1. Use a template (e.g., three-act structure) to map major beats.
2. Generate key turning points based on conflicts and character arcs.
3. **Next Action:** Validate the pacing and logical flow of events.

#### Step 4: **Scene Breakdown**
1. Populate scenes with summaries, purposes, and emotional impacts.
2. Assign cinematography elements (e.g., shot types, angles) using cinematic rules.
3. **Next Action:** Cross-check with the plot to ensure alignment.

#### Step 5: **Cinematic and Sound Design**
1. Suggest camera techniques and sound effects for key scenes.
2. Randomly generate visual elements to enhance creativity.
3. **Next Action:** Validate that these elements reinforce the story’s tone.

#### Step 6: **Symbolism and Themes**
1. Embed recurring motifs and symbols.
2. Use LangGraph to visualize how themes interconnect across the story.
3. **Next Action:** Review for thematic consistency.

#### Step 7: **Export and Review**
1. Compile all data into formatted documents.
2. Provide users with interactive feedback options for refinement.
3. **Next Action:** Iterate based on user feedback.

### Guardrails and Reference Checks

1. **Ensure Narrative Coherence:** Validate against storytelling frameworks like the three-act structure and Save the Cat beats.
2. **Adhere to Industry Standards:** Use script formatting rules (e.g., master scene format).
3. **Maintain Thematic Consistency:** Ensure all components reinforce the central theme.
4. **Respect Creative Control:** Allow users to override or refine automated suggestions.

### Example LangGraph Code Snippet

```python
from langgraph import Graph, Node

# Initialize LangGraph
graph = Graph(name="Story Dependency Graph")

# Create nodes for components
theme_node = Node("Theme", value="Redemption")
plot_node = Node("Plot", value="Hero overcomes loss")
character_node = Node("Protagonist", value="John Doe")

# Establish dependencies
graph.add_edge(theme_node, plot_node, label="drives")
graph.add_edge(plot_node, character_node, label="shapes")

# Visualize dependencies
graph.visualize(output="story_graph.png")
```

This program will empower storytellers with structured, creative, and iterative tools to craft compelling narratives efficiently.
