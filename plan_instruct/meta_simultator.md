# Metadata and Simulator Assistant

## Program Plan for Metadata Creation and Simulation Analysis

### Main Objective
To generate metadata summaries, create graph-based data visualizations, and simulate audience reactions to story elements. This assistant ensures stories are optimized for various demographics and provides tools to visually analyze narrative impact.

### Key Goals
1. **Metadata Generation:** Create comprehensive summaries for scenes, characters, and plot points.
2. **Graph-Based Visualizations:** Generate graphs to visualize relationships, themes, and audience engagement metrics.
3. **Demographic Simulations:** Simulate reactions from different audience groups to identify strengths and weaknesses.
4. **Graphical Analysis Tools:** Provide interactive tools to measure and understand narrative impact.


### Tools and Actions

#### **RAG Tools**
- **LangGraph Framework:** For mapping scene dependencies, shot sequences, and visual elements.
- **Cinematography Libraries:** For standard practices in lighting, camera setups, and framing.
- **Database Reference:** To store and track scene, shot, and viewer information data.

#### **Actions**
- **File Operations:** Writing and exporting scene documents in required formats.
- **Database Queries:** Fetching and updating data for scenes, shots, and consistency checks.
- **API Calls:** Invoking functions or external APIs for cinematic notes or diagram generation.
- **Validation Functions:** Ensuring consistency across visual and narrative elements.
- **Visualization Functions:** Generating graphs or diagrams for production planning.
- **Demographic Datasets:** For audience segmentation and simulation inputs.

### Modules and Functional Components

#### 1. **Metadata Generator**
   - Generate detailed summaries for scenes, characters, and narrative elements.
   - Use script and storyboard inputs to enhance metadata.

#### 2. **Graph Visualization Engine**
   - Create interactive graphs for character relationships, thematic connections, and plot dependencies.
   - Provide overlays for visualizing audience perception timelines.

#### 3. **Demographic Simulator**
   - Model audience reactions based on demographic data and story elements.
   - Use predictive algorithms to simulate emotional, cultural, and narrative impacts.

#### 4. **Analysis and Reporting Tool**
   - Provide graphical reports highlighting audience engagement, key themes, and potential risks.
   - Offer actionable insights for optimizing the story.

#### 5. **Export Module**
   - Export metadata and simulation results in formats suitable for presentations and iterative reviews.

### Example LangGraph Code Snippet

```python
from langgraph import Graph, Node

# Initialize LangGraph
graph = Graph(name="Metadata and Simulation Graph")

# Create nodes for components
scene_node = Node("Scene", value="Opening Scene")
audience_node = Node("Audience Reaction", value="Positive Engagement")
relationship_node = Node("Relationship", value="Character Dynamics")

# Establish dependencies
graph.add_edge(scene_node, audience_node, label="elicits")
graph.add_edge(scene_node, relationship_node, label="develops")

# Visualize graph
graph.visualize(output="metadata_simulation_graph.png")
```

---

# Transition to Feedback Loop
The metadata, graphs, and simulation results will be provided to the creative team for iterative reviews and enhancements.
