# Storyboard Assistant

## Program Plan for Storyboard Creation and Visualization

### Main Objective
To transform scenes into visual storyboards, adhering to cinematographer and director notes while ensuring consistency with plot, characters, and thematic elements.

### Key Goals
1. **Visual Prompt Generation:** Create detailed visual prompts for each scene based on script and cinematic plans.
2. **Consistency Management:** Ensure adherence to cinematographer and director notes, maintaining narrative and visual coherence.
3. **Image Crafting:** Use AI to generate high-quality images for storyboard frames.
4. **Editable Metadata:** Allow editing of visual, character, and plot details for precision.


### Tools and Actions

#### **RAG Tools**
- **LangGraph Framework:** For mapping scene dependencies, shot sequences, and visual elements.
- **Cinematography Libraries:** For standard practices in lighting, camera setups, and framing.
- **Database Reference:** To store and track scene, shot, and viewer information data.

#### **Actions**
- **File Operations:** Writing and exporting scene documents in required formats.
- **Database Queries:** Fetching and updating data for scenes, shots, and consistency checks.
- **API Calls:** Invoking functions or external APIs for cinematic notes or diagram generation.
- **Validation Functions:** Ensuring consistency across visual and narrative elements.
- **Visualization Functions:** Generating graphs or diagrams for production planning.
- **Image Processing Tools:** To refine storyboard visuals.
- **Frontend Interface:** For user edits and reviews of generated storyboards.

### Modules and Functional Components

#### 1. **Visual Prompt Generator**
   - Generate prompts based on scene descriptions, cinematography notes, and director input.
   - Include parameters like character placement, tone, and lighting.

#### 2. **Consistency Validator**
   - Validate visual prompts against story and plot details.
   - Ensure generated visuals align with thematic goals and character arcs.

#### 3. **Image Crafting Engine**
   - Use AI tools to generate initial storyboard images.
   - Enable refinement for style, tone, and accuracy.

#### 4. **Metadata Editor**
   - Allow users to edit character details, item placements, and scene metrics.
   - Track changes to maintain consistency across visuals.

#### 5. **Export Module**
   - Compile finalized storyboards into formats suitable for review and production.

### Process Steps

#### Step 1: **Visual Prompt Creation**
1. Parse scenes for visual elements (e.g., character positions, key props).
2. Incorporate cinematographer and director notes into prompts.
3. **Next Action:** Validate prompts against story and script details.

#### Step 2: **Storyboard Generation**
1. Generate storyboard frames using AI tools.
2. Ensure each frame captures the intended tone and narrative details.
3. **Next Action:** Review frames for consistency and quality.

#### Step 3: **User Review and Edits**
1. Provide users with editing tools for characters, props, and visual metrics.
2. Allow annotations for refinements or additional details.
3. **Next Action:** Validate updates and integrate them into the storyboard.

#### Step 4: **Consistency Validation**
1. Check for alignment of visuals with narrative and cinematographic plans.
2. Highlight discrepancies for resolution.
3. **Next Action:** Finalize frames and compile storyboards.

#### Step 5: **Export and Handover**
1. Compile storyboards into comprehensive documents for production use.
2. **Next Action:** Transition outputs to the Metadata and Simulator Assistant for metadata creation, demographic simulations, and audience impact analysis.

### Guardrails and Reference Checks

1. **Adherence to Cinematic Notes:** Ensure visuals align with shot types, angles, and lighting setups.
2. **Maintain Story Consistency:** Validate visuals against the script and plot details.
3. **Support Creative Control:** Enable user adjustments and refinements.
4. **Focus on Visual Clarity:** Ensure storyboard images effectively convey narrative intent.

### Example LangGraph Code Snippet

```python
from langgraph import Graph, Node

# Initialize LangGraph
graph = Graph(name="Storyboard Visual Dependency Graph")

# Create nodes for components
scene_node = Node("Scene", value="Opening Scene")
visual_node = Node("Visual Prompt", value="Wide shot of protagonist")
character_node = Node("Character", value="Protagonist details")

# Establish dependencies
graph.add_edge(scene_node, visual_node, label="derived from")
graph.add_edge(visual_node, character_node, label="includes")

# Validate consistency
graph.validate()
```

# Transition to Next Assistant
The finalized storyboards will be passed to the Metadata and Simulator Assistant for metadata creation, demographic simulations, and audience impact analysis.
